# To-Do List App

A simple React app to keep track of your to-dos. Created as an exercise for [The Complete React Developer](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-2nd-edition/) course.

Heads up that I don't use this tool anymore, I've moved to Notion for all my To-Do list and project management tools, so this repo isn't maintained anymore.

## Installation and running the app

1. `git clone https://github.com/imjuangarcia/todo-list-app/`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run start`
